# Installation

Right now the installation requires you have [go](https://go.dev) running on your computer. 
To start with move to the directory that you want to install the package to.

* `git clone https://github.com/alexstory/renelle && cd renelle`
* Windows - `go build -o rnl.exe main.go`
* Mac/Linux - `go build -o rnl main.go`

After that you can just run it with ./rnl or add it to your path.
