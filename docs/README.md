# renelle

> An experimental programming language.

Renelle is an experimental programming language for me to test things on and try new ideas as I build it. 

I tried to focus on having a clean syntax, with useful feature that would make work easier. At this point it probably has enough features to handle small features, but is not robust or performant enough to handle production workloads.

You can learn the basic syntax and such in [Getting Started](GettingStarted)

Some of the biggest influnces on renelle have been [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [F#](https://fsharp.org), and [Clojure](https://clojure.org)
